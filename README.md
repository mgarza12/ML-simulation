Project: "Two statistical models for simulating multi-label data" with Dr. G. Qian and Dr. J.H. Xue

Abstract

To select an appropriate classifier it is important to know under which circumstances the candidate classifiers will perform well or badly. A convincing and widely-accepted way to achieve this is through testing the classifiers under a controlled environment or simulated data, where the ground truth is known and can be modified. However, in multi-label classification, few articles have focused on methods of simulating multi-label data. In this paper, we present a study and comparison of two popular statistical models which are capable of simulating multi-label data. We aim to provide insights on how the models' parameters affect three important multi-label attributes, namely label density, imbalance and unconditional dependence, of the simulated data. In the end, our experiments suggest that the chain of logistic regressions model is a good choice to simulate data with moderate label dependence and imbalance, and the conditional logistic regression model is useful when high degrees of dependence and label imbalance are needed.
